### Recon Optimizer

***Current latest version: __3.0__***

### Warning!

A restore point is recommended to use. If any harm is done to your computer after this, don't blame me. I warned you.

### How to use

1. Click on Recon Optimizer down below to download it, or click [here](https://github.com/hydragotcash/ReconTweaks/releases/download/v3.0-ReconTweaks/Recon.Optimizer.zip).

2. Download [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
4. Right click on ReconOptimizer.zip, and if you used WinRAR there should be somewhere a button that says, "Extract to ReconOptimizer\". Click on it.
5. If you used 7-Zip, hover over 7-Zip and click "Extract to Recon Optimizer\".

10. Wait for it to do its work. When completed, Recon will automatically restart your computer for the changes to apply.

**Note: GitHub might rename the file to Recon.Optimizer. If that happens just do the steps normally since nothing will change. The source code that Recon uses is in the folder since it only uses batch and reg tweaks.**
